# Classify-Images-as-Dogs-or-Cats

The project involves a combination of custom CNN architecture , Transfer Learning techniques (InceptionNet as the pretrained models) and model improvement methods, to develop a deep learning solution for the dogs and cats image classification task.

**(More details in the Code.ipynb and Presentation.pdf file, model weights are stored in the json file.)**
